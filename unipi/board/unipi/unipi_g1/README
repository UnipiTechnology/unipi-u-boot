Introduction
============

RK3328 key features we might use in U-Boot:
* CPU: ARMv8 64bit quad-core Cortex-A53
* IRAM: 36KB
* DRAM: 4GB-16MB dual-channel
* eMMC: support eMMC 5.0/5.1, suport HS400, HS200, DDR50
* SD/MMC: support SD 3.0, MMC 4.51
* USB: USB2.0 EHCI host port *2
* Display: RGB/HDMI/DP/MIPI/EDP

UniPi G1 key features:
* regulator: pwm regulator for CPU B/L
* PMIC: rk808
* debug console: UART2

In order to support Arm Trust Firmware(ATF), we need to use the
miniloader from rockchip which:
* do DRAM init
* load and verify ATF image
* load and verify U-Boot image

Here is the step-by-step to boot to U-Boot on UniPi G1
